## Create Application Container Image

### Docker Container Image

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) performs the following steps:

1. It is based on Node.js.
1. It then clones the Pac-Man game into the configured application directory.
1. Exposes port 8080 for the web server.
1. Starts the Node.js application using `npm start`.

To build the image run:

```
cd docker
docker build -t <registry>/<user>/pacman-nodejs-app .
```

You can test the image by running:

```
docker run -p 8000:8080 <registry>/<user>/pacman-nodejs-app
```

And going to `http://localhost:8000/` to see if you get the Pac-Man game.

Once you're satisfied you can push the image to the container registry.

```
docker push <registry>/<user>/pacman-nodejs-app
```

### Building using an s2i image
